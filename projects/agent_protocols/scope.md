# Project Scope - Agent Protocols

## Webinar Info

### Title: 

The Race to Standardize Agentic Commerce

### Blurb

AI assistants are learning to shop. Google, Stripe/OpenAI, and Visa are rolling out new protocols that let agents transact on your behalf—raising urgent questions of trust, identity, and control. Join Dazza Greenwood and industry leaders for a fast-paced conversation on the future of agentic commerce and what it means for loyal, consumer-first AI.

### Description

The Race to Standardize Agentic Commerce

AI assistants are on the verge of doing more than just recommending what to buy—they’re about to buy it for you. That shift is spawning a wave of new standards and protocols, and some of the biggest players in tech and payments are racing to define the rules.

Join us for a high-energy, virtual panel hosted by Dazza Greenwood, bringing together experts from Google, Stripe/OpenAI, and Visa to unpack their groundbreaking approaches:

* Google AP2 (Agent-to-Pay Protocol): cryptographic “intent mandates” to prove user consent and secure transactions.
* Stripe + OpenAI’s Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP): a shared language letting AI agents check out with merchants via Instant Checkout in ChatGPT.
* Visa’s Intelligent Commerce Platform: AI-ready tokens, passkeys, and spending controls that give agents a wallet with built-in fraud protection.

We’ll explore how these frameworks intersect, compete, and complement each other—and what they mean for businesses, developers, policymakers, and consumers.

**Special Focus:** Identity and delegation. How do we let agents act with real autonomy while keeping them loyal to our interests? Expect insights on authentication, guardrails, and trust mechanisms from the teams building the future of commerce.

**Why attend?**

* Get a crash course on the standards that will power AI-driven transactions.
* Hear directly from the architects at Google, Stripe/OpenAI, and Visa.
* Understand where collaboration, competition, and convergence may take us next.

Don’t miss this rare chance to learn from the people shaping the infrastructure for consumer shopping agents.


## Project Overview
**Goal**: Develop content and materials for agent protocols webinar

**Timeline**: Setup phase - Webinar date TBD (few weeks)

**Priority**: High

## Context
**Background**: Dazza will be hosting a webinar on agent protocols in a few weeks. Need to prepare content, framework, and supporting materials.

**Stakeholders**: 
- Dazza (presenter)
- Webinar audience (TBD)
- Potential collaborators or co-presenters

**Constraints**: 
- Timeline is somewhat flexible but within "few weeks"
- Content depth and technical level to be determined based on audience
- Format and delivery method to be confirmed

## Success Criteria
**Primary Success**: Complete webinar content ready for delivery with clear, actionable framework for agent protocols

**Minimum Viable**: Basic outline and key talking points prepared with supporting examples

**Stretch Goals**: Interactive elements, case studies, and follow-up resources for attendees

## Deliverables
1. Webinar outline and structure
2. Key content and talking points
3. Supporting materials (slides, handouts, etc.)


## Notes
- Detailed scope to be refined once Dazza provides specific requirements
- Content focus (technical vs. business vs. practical) depends on audience definition
- May include elements from previous agent work and research
- Consider integration with current AI tool landscape and practical applications

---

**Status**: Placeholder scope created. Awaiting detailed requirements from Dazza to complete scope definition and begin content development.
