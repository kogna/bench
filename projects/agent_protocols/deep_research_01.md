Technical Analysis: Google AP2, OpenAI/Stripe ACP, and Visa Intelligent Commerce Protocols
==========================================================================================

Executive Summary
-----------------

The emergence of AI agent-driven commerce in 2025 has prompted the development of three major payment protocols: Google's Agent Payments Protocol (AP2), OpenAI/Stripe's Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP), and Visa's Trusted Agent Protocol within their Intelligent Commerce framework. Each protocol addresses the fundamental challenge of enabling autonomous AI agents to conduct secure financial transactions while maintaining trust, security, and accountability.

Cryptographic Implementation Differences
----------------------------------------

Google AP2: Verifiable Credentials Architecture
-----------------------------------------------

AP2 employs **ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)** signatures for creating cryptographically signed "Mandates" that serve as tamper-proof digital contracts. The protocol utilizes three distinct credential types:

 kenhuangus.substack​* • **Cart Mandate**: Contains verifiable identities, tokenized payment methods, and exact transaction details with ECDSA signatures using secp256k1 curves
* • **Intent Mandate**: Signed authorization for future transactions with TTL (Time-to-Live) parameters
* • **Payment Mandate**: Provides network visibility with additional cryptographic proofs for AI agent presence

 ap2-protocol​

Security analysis reveals AP2's CVSS base score of **5.8 for Cart Mandates** (Moderate) and **7.2 for Intent Mandates** (High), with the async nature of Intent Mandates presenting higher risk profiles. The protocol implements:

 kenhuangus.substack​text`Sig_U(M) = ECDSA.Sign(K_U, Hash(M))
  
Verification: ECDSA.Verify(Pub_K_U, Hash(M), Sig_U(M)) → Boolean`

OpenAI/Stripe ACP: Shared Payment Token System
----------------------------------------------

ACP leverages Stripe's existing tokenization infrastructure with a **simplified cryptographic approach**:

 starpointllp​* • **Shared Payment Tokens (SPT)**: Time and amount-limited tokens mapped to network token services (Visa's VTS, Mastercard's MDES)
* • **Device Graph Integration**: Fingerprinting across Stripe's global network for passive authentication
* • **Risk Signal Embedding**: Machine learning-enhanced tokens with embedded fraud indicators

 starpointllp​

The protocol requires approximately **50 lines of code** compared to AP2's 200+ lines, focusing on REST API implementations rather than complex cryptographic signing chains.

API Vulnerability Assessments
-----------------------------

Critical Vulnerabilities Identified
-----------------------------------

Recent security audits from October 2025 reveal several vulnerability patterns across all three protocols:

AP2 Vulnerabilities
-------------------

* • **Mandate Spoofing**: Potential for malicious agents to forge Intent Mandates (mitigation: hardware-backed key management)

 kenhuangus.substack​
* • **Agent Coercion**: Risk of compromised agents executing unauthorized transactions
* • **Quantum Threat Exposure**: Current ECDSA implementation vulnerable to future quantum attacks using Shor's algorithm

 nacha​
* • **Simulated fraud rate**: 1.15% (improved from 2.1% baseline)

 kenhuangus.substack​

ACP Vulnerabilities
-------------------

* • **Infrastructure Dependency**: Single point of failure through Stripe's centralized token system
* • **Limited Autonomy**: Human approval requirements create potential social engineering vectors
* • **Cross-platform Token Leakage**: Risk when tokens traverse multiple payment processors

 starpointllp​

Visa Protocol Vulnerabilities
-----------------------------

* • **Gatekeeper Risk**: Visa's centralized approval process for agent credentials creates monopolistic control
* • **Bot Detection Bypass**: 4,700% increase in AI traffic overwhelming traditional detection systems

 venturebeat​
* • **Cryptographic Key Management**: Challenges in rotating keys across distributed merchant systems

 helpnetsecurity​

MCP Integration Vulnerabilities
-------------------------------

All protocols integrating with Model Context Protocol (MCP) face emerging threats:

 stytch​* • **Line Jumping Attacks**: Prompt injection through malicious tool descriptions
* • **Silent Backdoors**: Hidden instructions in tool metadata
* • **Remote Code Execution**: Through compromised MCP servers

Authentication Mechanisms
-------------------------

Multi-Layer Authentication Comparison
--------------------------------------

| Protocol | Primary Auth | Secondary Auth | Biometric Support | Quantum-Safe |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **AP2** | ECDSA Signatures | Intent Mandates | Via Device | No |
| **ACP** | SPT + Device Graph | Stripe Radar ML | Link Account | No |
| **Visa** | Digital Signatures | 3DS2 Step-up | Device ID | Planning |

Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) Integration
------------------------------------------------

**AP2** implements SCA through step-up protocols for transactions over $100, leveraging Android GMSCore DPC for biometric confirmation. **ACP** utilizes Stripe's existing SCA infrastructure with automatic 3DS2 triggering based on risk scores. **Visa's protocol** embeds SCA requirements directly into the Trusted Agent verification flow.

Security Hardening Priorities
-----------------------------

* 1. **Implement hardware-backed key management** (TPM/HSM) for all agent signing operations
* 2. **Deploy quantum-safe pilot programs** using hybrid cryptographic schemes
* 3. **Establish 90-day key rotation** policies with automated revocation
* 4. **Create centralized mandate repositories** with real-time reconciliation

Governance and Compliance Framework
-----------------------------------

Develop comprehensive policies addressing:

* • **Agent liability assignment** matrices for each protocol
* • **Cross-protocol transaction monitoring** with unified fraud detection
* • **Regulatory compliance mapping** for EU, U.S., and global markets
* • **Dispute resolution procedures** leveraging each protocol's evidence mechanisms

The protocol wars of 2025 represent a pivotal moment in payment infrastructure evolution. While no single standard has achieved dominance, the convergence toward interoperability suggests a future where multiple protocols coexist, requiring sophisticated orchestration layers to manage the complexity of AI-driven commerce.
