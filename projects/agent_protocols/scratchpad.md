# Scratchpad - Agent Protocols

## Current Status
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-15 17:04 PDT

**Current Phase**: Research & Materials Development

**Progress Summary**:
- Repository context reviewed and identities confirmed [agent + principal]
- Agent Protocols project structure verified (scope + scratchpad)
- Created protocol_info.md with consolidated protocol profiles and comparative analysis
- Ran Perplexity Deep Research (technical analysis) and saved verbatim output as deep_research_01.md

## Next Actions (Immediate)
- [ ] Deep Research 02: Business/adoption metrics and merchant implementation status (save as deep_research_02.md)
- [ ] Deep Research 03: Regulatory/legal frameworks and liability models (deep_research_03.md)
- [ ] Deep Research 04: Ecosystem dynamics, network effects, and interoperability (deep_research_04.md)
- [ ] Synthesize findings into panel question bank and talking points (panel_questions.md)
- [ ] Draft webinar outline and slide structure (outline.md + slides deck skeleton)

## Research & Findings
### Current State of Agent Protocols
- AP2: Crypto-signed mandates, A2A/MCP aligned, broad scope, discovery unsolved, 60+ partners
- ACP: Merchant REST checkout + delegate payment tokens, production-ready, merchant-centric
- Visa: Trusted Agent within Intelligent Commerce; 5 integrated APIs; live with fraud protection scale

### Key Comparisons (from protocol_info.md)
- Philosophy: cryptographic consent vs merchant simplicity vs payment infrastructure security
- Readiness: AP2 WIP; ACP production-ready; Visa live platform
- Interop: AP2 agent-to-agent; ACP merchant API; Visa platform-agnostic with certification

## Draft Content
### Webinar Outline (initial)
1. Context: Why agentic commerce now
2. The three models: AP2, ACP, Visa (strengths/limits)
3. Trust, identity, and consent: technical + legal
4. Interop and discovery: open problems
5. Case studies and demos (TBD)
6. Panel discussion prompts

### Panel Seed Questions
- How will agent discovery be solved across ecosystems?
- What liability allocations emerge for unauthorized agent actions?
- Can cryptographic proofs substitute for network-level fraud detection?
- What incentives exist for merchants to support multiple protocols?

## Decisions Made
**2025-10-15**:
- Store Deep Research outputs verbatim per run for traceability
- Maintain synthesized report (protocol_info.md) separately for clarity

## Issues & Blockers
- Audience and technical depth still to be finalized
- Webinar date, duration, and panelist confirmations pending

## Ideas & Notes
- Consider including Skyfire (identity) to balance protocol authors
- Align framing with consumer-first agent loyalty and guardrails
- Explore demo feasibility (e.g., ACP test flow; AP2 mock mandate signing)
