- Goal: Improve the UI/UX of the attached mini-webapp so that it is easier to use and more powerful for quickly navigating long complex markdown docs by folding-text (the existing basic approach for viewing H1 or H1+H2 and easy to expand/collapse but improving this) and adding an easy way to filter all lines that start with a tag in the following format @@tag (eg @@task or @@topic etc). including providing a list of all such tags unfolding at a click on a button labeled "tags" so user can then click a tag to get the filtered view.
- Status: Round 1 - Initial collaboration established, ChatGPT confirmed understanding and provided comprehensive approach
