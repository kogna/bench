# AI Capabilities - Trial and Error Learning

## IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER
**These capabilities are documented to the best of our knowledge based on trial and error mostly. Your capabilities may be significantly reduced, changed, or increased at any time and without prior notice to either of us!**

## GitHub Repository Management
- MCP GitHub tools work reliably for file operations
- Can create, update, and manage repository structure
- Branch management and commit operations function well
- Issue and pull request management capabilities available

## Browser Integration
- Can read browser tabs and history effectively
- Browser control tools work for automated interactions
- Tab management and organization functions properly
- Local file access through file:// URLs works

## Research and Analysis
- Web search provides current information effectively
- Can retrieve and analyze full page content
- Memory search accesses user preferences and context
- Email and calendar search functions available

## Code and Data Processing
- Python execution works for calculations and data analysis
- Chart creation capabilities for data visualization
- File processing and format conversion possible

## Working Patterns That Succeed
- Simple, focused project structures over complex architectures
- Clear step-by-step task breakdown
- Regular memory updates for session continuity
- Practical tool usage over theoretical discussions

## Known Limitations
- Cannot download files directly
- Cannot guarantee consistent capability availability
- Tool performance may vary without warning
- Some operations require user approval for execution

## Notes
- Update this file when new patterns are discovered
- Focus on what actually works in practice
- Document failures as well as successes for future reference
